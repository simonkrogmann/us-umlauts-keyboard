# us-umlauts-keyboard
A US keyboard layout with German, Spanish and Catalan special characters and other useful symbols. These characters can be accessed with AltGr (lowercase) and AltGr+Shift (uppercase):

| Character | On letter |
| --------- | --------- |
| ä | a |
| ö | o |
| ü | u |
| ß | s |
| ñ | n |
| ¡ | 1 (!) |
| § | 3 |
| ¿ | / (?) |
| € | e and 5 |
| ç | c |
| £ | l |
| μ | m |
| @ | q |
| · | . |

Additionally, AltGr+` is a dead key for creating accents (á, é, ...).
However, the grave accent (`) is not yet included.

## Installation
Layouts for X11 and kbd are included. The installation script works for Gnome installed on Arch Linux. For other setups the keyboard layout should probably be changed manually.
