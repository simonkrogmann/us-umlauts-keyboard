| ä | a |
| ö | o |
| ï | i |
| ü | u |
| ß | s |
| ñ | n |
| ¡ | 1 (!) |
| § | 3 |
| ¿ | / (?) |
| € | e and 5 |
| ç | c |
| £ | l |
| μ | m |

| · | . |

Additionally, AltGr+` is a dead key for creating accents:
AltGr+` for á, é, ... and Shift+AltGr+` for à, è, ...

## Installation
Layouts for X11 and kbd are included. The installation script works for Gnome installed on Arch Linux. For other setups the keyboard layout should probably be changed manually.
